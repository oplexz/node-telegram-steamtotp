# tg-steam-2fa

A simple bot that allows you to receive Steam Guard codes via Telegram

### Usage:
- Clone the repository
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the fields
- Add accounts to the `accounts` directory (files should start with `Steamguard-`)
- Run `index.js` (preferably with pm2 - tends to crash every now and then)

### TODO:
- Rewrite
